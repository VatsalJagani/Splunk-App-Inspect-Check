- complete test with lansweeper

new input app_id


create issue for support of creating build under root directory directly


app_id in the documentation

app_id:
    description: "App/Add-on's directory name when extracted/installed in Splunk. Value is generally found in app.conf's [package] stanza's id attribute. If the attribute is present in the app.conf then no need to provide this input, otherwise provide the input."
    required: false
    default: "app.conf[package]id"

-> create issue 


line number 79 - if [[ "$VAR1" == "$VAR2" ]] -> provide condition


use package_id instead of app-id


remove js part of the composite action -> direct use python file execution


print app-id in all the logs that will be printed


execute whole code into single python file to avoid all environment variable and all other problems
-> perform user code
-> execute python
-> run all linux commands from python as well
-> change code structure as well
-> at the end just perform the archive
-> before starting perform clean-up activity if required like removing reports dir


- name and description change in action.yml file


- add tests
  - for running checks of user defined command running
  - for running on repo's root dir vs inner repo
  - test for multiple app in same repo


Run main.py with -u option for running without buffer
